# Mercury 
Mercury is a Sinatra-inspired web framework for building website applications and APIs. It is an experimental web server in Node that allows arbitrary callbacks to be registered based on request methods and parameters. It implements request routing logic on top of the “http” package from the Node.js standard library and builds support for middleware functions using recursive methods.
